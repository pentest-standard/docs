<section id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The aim of this section of the PTES is to present and explain the tools
and techniques available which aid in a successful pre-engagement step
of a penetration test. The information within this section is the result
of the many years of combined experience of some of the most successful
penetration testers in the world.</p>
<p>If you are a customer looking for penetration test we strongly recommend
going to the General Questions section of this document. It covers the
major questions that should be answered before a test begins. Remember,
a penetration test should not be confrontational. It should not be an
activity to see if the tester can “hack” you. It should be about
identifying the business risk associated with and attack.</p>
<p>To get maximum value, make sure the questions in this document are
covered. Further, as the Scoping activity progresses, a good testing
firm will start to ask additional questions tailored to your
organization.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction-to-scope">
<h2>Introduction to Scope<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-scope" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Defining scope is arguably one of the most important components of a
penetration test, yet it is also one of the most overlooked. While many
volumes have been written about the different tools and techniques which
can be utilized to gain access to a network, very little has been
written on the topic which precedes the penetration: preparation.
Neglecting to properly complete pre-engagement activities has the
potential to open the penetration tester (or his firm) to a number of
headaches including scope creep, unsatisfied customers, and even legal
troubles. The scope of a project specifically defines what is to be
tested. How each aspect of the test will be conducted will be covered in
the Rules of Engagement section.</p>
<p>One key component of scoping an engagement is outlining how the testers
should spend their time. As an example, a customer requests that one
hundred IP addresses be tested for the price of $100,000. This means
that the customer is offering $1,000 per IP address tested. However,
this cost structure only remains effective at that volume. A common trap
some testers fall into is maintaining linear costs throughout the
testing process. If the customer had only asked for one
business-critical application to be tested at the same pricing structure
($1,000), while the tester will still be only attacking a single IP, the
volume of work has increased dramatically. It is important to vary costs
based on work done. Otherwise a firm can easily find themselves
undercharging for their services, which motivates them to do a less than
complete job.</p>
<p>Despite having a solid pricing structure, the process is not all black
and white. It is not uncommon for a client to be completely unaware of
exactly what it is they need tested. It is also possible the client will
not know how to communicate effectively what they’re expecting from the
test. It is important in the Pre-Engagement phase that the tester is
able to serve as a guide through what may be uncharted territory for a
customer. The tester must understand the difference between a test which
focuses on a single application with severe intensity and a test where
the client provides a wide range of IP addresses to test and the goal is
to simply find a way in.</p>
</section>
<section id="metrics-for-time-estimation">
<h2>Metrics for Time Estimation<a class="headerlink" href="#metrics-for-time-estimation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Time estimations are directly tied to the experience of a tester in a
certain area. If a tester has significant experience in a certain test,
he will likely innately be able to determine how long a test will take.
If the tester has less experience in the area, re-reading emails and
scan logs from previous similar tests the firm has done is a great way
to estimate the time requirement for the current engagement. Once the
time to test is determined, it is a prudent practice to add 20% to the
time.</p>
<p>The extra 20% on the back end of the time value is called padding.
Outside of consultant circles, this is also referred to as consultant
overhead. The padding is an absolute necessity for any test. It provides
a cushion should any interruptions occur in the testing. There are many
events which commonly occur and hinder the testing process. For example,
a network segment may go down, or a significant vulnerability may be
found which requires many meetings with many levels of management to
address. Both of these events are time consuming and would significantly
impact the original time estimate if the padding was not in place.</p>
<p>What happens if the 20% padding ends up not being necessary? Billing the
client for time not worked would be extremely unethical, so it is up to
the testers to provide additional value that may not normally have been
provided if the engagement time limit had been hit. Examples include
walking the company security team through the steps taken to exploit the
vulnerability, provide an executive summary if it was not part of the
original deliverable list, or spend some additional time trying to crack
a vulnerability that was elusive during the initial testing.</p>
<p>Another component of the metrics of time and testing is that every
project needs to have a definitive drop dead date. All good projects
have a well-defined beginning and end. You will need to have a signed
statement of work specifying the work and the hours required if you’ve
reached the specific date the testing is to end, or if any additional
testing or work is requested of you after that date. Some testers have a
difficult time doing this because they feel they are being too much of a
pain when it comes to cost and hours. However, it has been the
experience of the author that if you provide exceptional value for the
main test the customer will not balk at paying you for additional work.</p>
</section>
<section id="scoping-meeting">
<h2>Scoping Meeting<a class="headerlink" href="#scoping-meeting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In many cases the scoping meeting will occur after the contract has been
signed. Situations do occur wherein many of the scope-related topics can
be discussed before contract signing, but they are few and far between.
For those situations it is recommended that a non-disclosure agreement
be signed before any in-depth scoping discussions occur.</p>
<p>The goal of the scoping meeting is to discuss what will be tested. Rules
of engagement and costs will not be covered in this meeting. Each of
these subjects should be handled in meetings where each piece is the
focus of that meeting. This is done because discussions can easily
become confused and muddled if focus is not explicitly stated. It is
important to act as moderator and keep the discussions on-topic,
preventing tangents and declaring certain topics more suited for
off-line discussion when necessary.</p>
<p>Now that a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) value has been established for
the project it is time to have a meeting with the customer to validate
assumptions. First, it needs to be established explicitly what IP ranges
are in scope for the engagement. It is not uncommon for a client to be
resistant and assume that it is the prerogative of the tester to
identify their network and attack it, to make the test as realistic as
possible. This would indeed be an ideal circumstance, however, possible
legal ramifications must be considered above all else. Because of this,
it is the responsibility of the tester to convey to a client these
concerns and to impart upon them the importance of implicit scoping. For
example, in the meeting, it should be verified that the customer owns
all of the target environments including: the DNS server, the email
server, the actual hardware their web servers run on and their
firewall/IDS/IPS solution. There are a number of companies which will
outsource the management of these devices to third parties.</p>
<p>Additionally, the countries, provinces, and states in which the target
environments operate in must be identified. Laws vary from region to
region and the testing may very well be impacted by these laws. For
instance, countries belonging to the European Union are well known to
have very stringent laws surrounding the privacy of individuals, which
can significantly change the manner in which a social engineering
engagement would be executed.</p>
</section>
<section id="additional-support-based-on-hourly-rate">
<h2>Additional Support Based on Hourly Rate<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-support-based-on-hourly-rate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Anything that is not explicitly covered within the scope of the
engagement should be handled very carefully. The first reason for this
is scope creep. As the scope expands, resources are consumed, cutting
into the profits for the tester and may even create confusion and anger
on the part of the customer. There is another issue that many testers do
not think of when taking on additional work on an ad-hoc basis: legal
ramifications. Many ad-hoc requests are not properly documented so it
can be difficult to determine who said what in the event of a dispute or
legal action. Further, the contract is a legal document specifying the
work that is to be done. It should be tightly tied to the permission to
test memo.</p>
<p>Any requests outside of the original scope should be documented in the
form of a statement of work that clearly identifies the work to be done.
We also recommend that it be clearly stated in the contract that
additional work will be done for a flat fee per hour and explicitly
state that additional work can not be completed until a signed and
counter-signed SOW is in place.</p>
</section>
<section id="questionnaires">
<h2>Questionnaires<a class="headerlink" href="#questionnaires" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>During initial communications with the customer there are several
questions which the client will have to answer in order for the
engagement scope can be properly estimated. These questions are designed
to provide a better understanding of what the client is looking to gain
out of the penetration test, why the client is looking to have a
penetration test performed against their environment, and whether or not
they want certain types of tests performed during the penetration test.
The following are sample questions which may be asked during this phase.</p>

<h2>Scope Creep<a class="headerlink" href="#scope-creep" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Scope creep is one of the most efficient ways to put a penetration
testing firm out of business. The issue is that many companies and
managers have little to no idea how to identify it, or how to react to
it when it happens.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things to remember when battling scope creep.
First, if a customer is pleased with the work done on a particular
engagement, it is very common for them to request additional work. Take
this as a compliment, and do not hesitate to ask for additional funding
to compensate for the extra time spent. If a customer refuses to pay for
the extra work, it is almost never worth staying on to do that work.</p>
<p>The second point is even more critical. When dealing with existing
customers, take care to keep the prices lower. Taking advantage of a
good situation by price gouging is a sure way to drive away repeat
business. Take into consideration that prices can be lowered since the
firm avoided the costs of acquiring the customer such as the formal RFP
process and hunting for the customer itself. Further, the best source
for future work is through existing customers. Treat them well and they
will return.</p>
</section>
<section id="specify-start-and-end-dates">
<h2>Specify Start and End Dates<a class="headerlink" href="#specify-start-and-end-dates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Another key component defeating scope creep is explicitly stating start
and end dates. This allows the project to have definite end. One of the
most common areas in which scope creep occurs is during retesting.
Retesting always sounds like a good idea when going after a contract. It
shows that the firm is caring and diligent, trying to make ensure that
the customer is secure as possible. The problem begins when it is
forgotten that the work is not paid for until it is completed. This
includes retesting.</p>
<p>To mitigate this risk, add a simple statement to the contract which
mentions that all retesting must be done within a certain timeframe
after the final report delivery. It then becomes the responsibility of
the testers to spearhead the retesting effort. If the customer requests
an extension, always allow this with the condition that payment be
fulfilled at the originally specified date. Finally, and most
importantly, perform a quality retest. Remember, the best source for
future work is your existing customer base.</p>
</section>
<section id="specify-ip-ranges-and-domains">
<h2>Specify IP Ranges and Domains<a class="headerlink" href="#specify-ip-ranges-and-domains" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before starting a penetration test, all targets must be identified.
These targets should be obtained from the customer during the initial
questionnaire phase. Targets can be given in the form of specific IP
addresses, network ranges, or domain names by the customer. In some
instances, the only target the customer provides is the name of the
organization and expects the testers be able to identify the rest on
their own. It is important to define if systems like firewalls and
IDS/IPS or networking equipment that are between the tester and the
final target are also part of the scope. Additional elements such as
upstream providers, and other 3rd party providers should be identified
and defined whether they are in scope or not.</p>
<section id="validate-ranges">
<h3>Validate Ranges<a class="headerlink" href="#validate-ranges" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is imperative that before you start to attack the targets you
validate that they are in fact owned by the customer you are performing
the test against. Think of the legal consequences you may run into if
you start attacking a machine and successfully penetrate it only to find
out later down the line that the machine actually belongs to another
organization (such as a hospital or government agency).</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="dealing-with-third-parties">
<h2>Dealing with Third Parties<a class="headerlink" href="#dealing-with-third-parties" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of situations where an engagement will include
testing a service or an application that is being hosted by a third
party. This has become more prevalent in recent years as “cloud”
services have become more popular. The most important thing to remember
is that while permission may have been granted by the client, they do
not speak for their third party providers. Thus, permission must be
obtained from them as well in order to test the hosted systems. Failing
to obtain the proper permissions brings with it, as always, the
possibility of violating the law, which can cause endless headaches.</p>
<section id="cloud-services">
<h3>Cloud Services<a class="headerlink" href="#cloud-services" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The single biggest issue with testing cloud service is there is data
from multiple different organizations stored on one physical medium.
Often the security between these different data domains is very lax. The
cloud services provider needs to be alerted to the testing and needs to
acknowledge that the test is occurring and grant the testing
organization permission to test. Further, there needs to be a direct
security contact within the cloud service provider that can be contacted
in the event that a security vulnerability is discovered which may
impact the other cloud customers. Some cloud providers have specific
procedures for penetration testers to follow, and may require request
forms, scheduling or explicit permission from them before testing can
begin.</p>
</section>
<section id="isp">
<h3>ISP<a class="headerlink" href="#isp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Verify the ISP terms of service with the customer. In many commercial
situations the ISP will have specific provisions for testing. Review
these terms carefully before launching an attack. There are situations
where ISPs will shun and block certain traffic which is considered
malicious. The customer may approve this risk, but it must always be
clearly communicated before beginning.</p>
</section>
<section id="web-hosting">
<h3>Web Hosting<a class="headerlink" href="#web-hosting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As with all other third parties, the scope and timing of the test needs
to be clearly communicated with the web hosting provider. Also, when
communicating with the client, be sure to clearly articulate the test
will only be in search of web vulnerabilities. The test will not uncover
vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure which may still provide
an avenue to compromise the application.</p>
</section>
<section id="mssps">
<h3>MSSPs<a class="headerlink" href="#mssps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Managed Security Service Providers also may need to be notified of
testing. Specifically, they will need to be notified when the systems
and services that they own are to be tested. However, there are
circumstances under which the MSSP would not be notified. If determining
the actual response time of the MSSP is part of the test, it is
certainly not in the best interest of the integrity of the test for the
MSSP to be notified. As a general rule of thumb, any time a device or
service explicitly owned by the MSSP is being tested they will need to
be notified.</p>
</section>
<section id="countries-where-servers-are-hosted">
<h3>Countries Where Servers are Hosted<a class="headerlink" href="#countries-where-servers-are-hosted" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is also in the best interests of the tester to verify the countries
where servers are being housed. After you have validated the country,
review the laws of the specific country before beginning testing. It
should not be assumed that the firm’s legal team will provide a complete
synopsis of local laws for the testers. It should also not be assumed
that the firm will take legal responsibility for any laws violated by
its testers. It is the responsibility of each tester to verify the laws
for each region they are testing in before they begin testing because it
will be the tester who ultimately will have to answer for any
transgressions.</p>

<section id="define-acceptable-social-engineering-pretexts">
<h2>Define Acceptable Social Engineering Pretexts<a class="headerlink" href="#define-acceptable-social-engineering-pretexts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many organizations will want their security posture tested in a way
which is aligned with current attacks. Social engineering and
spear-phishing attacks are currently widely used by many attackers
today. While most of the successful attacks use pretexts like sex,
drugs, and rock and roll (porn, Viagra, and free iPods respectively)
some of these pretexts may not be acceptable in a corporate environment.
Be sure that any pretexts chosen for the test are approved in writing
before testing is to begin.</p>
</section>
<section id="dos-testing">
<h2>DoS Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#dos-testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Stress testing or Denial of Service testing should be discussed before
the engagement begins. It can be a topic that many organizations are
uncomfortable with due to the potentially damaging nature of the
testing. If an organization is only worried about the confidentiality or
integrity of their data, stress testing may not be necessary; however,
if the organization is also worried about the availability of their
services, then the stress testing should be conducted in a
non-production environment which is identical to the production
environment.</p>
</section>
<section id="payment-terms">
<h2>Payment Terms<a class="headerlink" href="#payment-terms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Another aspect of preparing for a test that many testers completely
forget about is how they should be paid. Just like contract dates there
should be specific dates and terms for payments. It is not uncommon for
larger organizations to delay payment for as long as possible. Below are
a few common payment methods. These are simply examples. It is
definitely recommended that each organization create and tweak their own
pricing structure to more aptly suit the needs of their clients and
themselves. The important thing is that some sort of structure be in
place before testing begins.</p>
<section id="net-30">
<h3>Net 30<a class="headerlink" href="#net-30" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The total amount is due within 30 days of the delivery of the final
report. This is usually associated with a per month percentage penalty
for non-payment. This can be any number of days you wish to grant your
customers (i.e. 45, or 60).</p>
</section>
<section id="half-upfront">
<h3>Half Upfront<a class="headerlink" href="#half-upfront" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is not uncommon to require half of the total bill upfront before
testing begins. This is very common for longer-term engagements.</p>
</section>
<section id="recurring">
<h3>Recurring<a class="headerlink" href="#recurring" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A recurring payment schedule is more commonly used for long-term
engagements. For example, some engagements may span as far as a year or
two. It is not at all uncommon to have the customer pay in regular
installments throughout the year.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="goals">
<h2>Goals<a class="headerlink" href="#goals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Every penetration test should be goal-oriented. This is to say that the
purpose of the test is to identify specific vulnerabilities that lead to
a compromise of the business or mission objectives of the customer. It
is not about finding un-patched systems. It is about identifying risk
that will adversely impact the organization.</p>
<section id="primary">
<h3>Primary<a class="headerlink" href="#primary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The primary goal of a test should not be driven by compliance. There are
a number of different justifications for this reasoning. First,
compliance does not equal security. While it should be understood that
many organizations undergo testing because of compliance it should not
be the main goal of the test. For example, a firm may be hired to
complete a penetration test as part of PCI-DSS requirements.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of companies which process credit card information.
However, the traits which make the target organization unique and viable
in a competitive market will have the greatest impact if compromised.
Credit card systems being compromised would certainly be a serious
issue, but credit cards numbers, along with all of the associated
customer data being leaked would be catastrophic.</p>
</section>
<section id="secondary">
<h3>Secondary<a class="headerlink" href="#secondary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The secondary goals are directly related to compliance. It is not
uncommon for primary and secondary goals to be very closely related. For
example, in the example of the PCI-DSS driven test, getting the credit
cards is the secondary goal. Tying that breach of data to the business
or mission drivers of the organization is the primary goal. Secondary
goals mean something for compliance and/or IT. Primary goals get the
attention of upper management.</p>
</section>
<section id="business-analysis">
<h3>Business Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#business-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Before performing a penetration test it is beneficial to determine the
maturity level of the client’s security posture. There are a number of
organizations which choose to jump directly into a penetration test
first assessing this maturity level. For customers with a very immature
security program, it is often a good idea to perform a vulnerability
analysis first.</p>
<p>Some testers believe there is a stigma surrounding Vulnerability
Analysis (VA) work. Those testers have forgotten that the goal is to
identify risks in the target organization, not about pursuing the
so-called “rockstar” lifestyle. If a company is not ready for a full
penetration test, they will get far more value out of a good VA than a
penetration test.</p>
<p>Establish with the customer in advance what information about the
systems they will be providing. It may also be helpful to ask for
information about vulnerabilities which are already documented. This
will save the testers time and save the client money by not overlapping
testing discoveries with known issues. Likewise, a full or partial
white-box test may bring the customer more value than a black-box test,
if it isn’t absolutely required by compliance.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="establish-lines-of-communication">
<h2>Establish Lines of Communication<a class="headerlink" href="#establish-lines-of-communication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the most important aspects of any penetration test is
communication with the customer. How often you interact with the
customer, and the manner in which you approach them, can make a huge
difference in their feeling of satisfaction. Below is a communication
framework that will aid in making the customer feel comfortable about
the test activities.</p>
</section>
<section id="emergency-contact-information">
<h2>Emergency Contact Information<a class="headerlink" href="#emergency-contact-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Obviously, being able to get in touch with the customer or target
organization in an emergency is vital. Emergencies may arise, and a
point of contact must have been established in order to handle them.
Create an emergency contact list. This list should include contact
information for all parties in the scope of testing. Once created, the
emergency contact list should be shared with all those on the list. Keep
in mind, the target organization may not be the customer.</p>
<p>Gather the following information about each emergency contact:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Full name</p></li>
<li><p>Title and operational responsibility</p></li>
<li><p>Authorization to discuss details of the testing activities, if not
already specified</p></li>
<li><p>Two forms of 24/7 immediate contact, such as cell phone, pager, or
home phone, if possible</p></li>
<li><p>One form of secure bulk data transfer, such as SFTP or encrypted
email</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note: The number for a group such as the help desk or operations center
can replace one emergency contact, but only if it is staffed 24/7. The
nature of each penetration test influences who should be on the
emergency contact list. Not only will contact information for the
customer and targets need to be made available, but they may also need
to contact the testers in an emergency. The list should preferably
include the following people:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>All penetration testers in the test group for the engagement</p></li>
<li><p>The manager of the test group</p></li>
<li><p>Two technical contacts at each target organization</p></li>
<li><p>Two technical contacts at the customer</p></li>
<li><p>One upper management or business contact at the customer</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is possible that there will be some overlap in the above list. For
instance, the target organization may be the customer, the test group’s
manager may also be performing the penetration test, or a customer’s
technical contact may be in upper management. It is also recommended to
define a single contact person per involved party who leads it and takes
responsibility on behalf of it.</p>
<section id="incident-reporting-process">
<h3>Incident Reporting Process<a class="headerlink" href="#incident-reporting-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Discussing the organization’s current incident response capabilities is
important to do before an engagement for several reasons. Part of a
penetration test is not only testing the security an organization has in
place, but also their incident response capabilities.</p>
<p>If an entire engagement can be completed without the target’s internal
security teams ever noticing, a major gap in security posture has been
identified. It is also important to ensure that before testing begins,
someone at the target organization is aware of when the tests are being
conducted so the incident response team does not start to call every
member of upper management in the middle of the night because they
thought they were under attack or compromised.</p>
</section>
<section id="incident-definition">
<h3>Incident Definition<a class="headerlink" href="#incident-definition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines an
incident as follows: “a violation or imminent threat of violation of
computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard
security practices.” (Computer Security Incident Handling Guide -
Special Publication 800-61 Rev 1). An incident can also occur on a
physical level, wherein a person gain unauthorized physical access to an
area by any means. The target organization should have different
categories and levels for different types of incidents.</p>
</section>
<section id="status-report-frequency">
<h3>Status Report Frequency<a class="headerlink" href="#status-report-frequency" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The frequency of status reporting can vary widely. Some factors which
influence the reporting schedule include the overall length of the test,
the test scope, and the target’s security maturity. An effective
schedule allows the customer to feel engaged. An ignored customer is a
former customer.</p>
<p>Once frequency and schedule of status reports has been set, it must be
fulfilled. Postponing or delaying a status report may be necessary, but
it should not become chronic. The client may be asked to agree to a new
schedule if necessary. Skipping a status report altogether is
unprofessional and should be avoided if at all possible.</p>
</section>
<section id="pgp-and-other-alternatives">
<h3>PGP and Other Alternatives<a class="headerlink" href="#pgp-and-other-alternatives" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Encryption is not optional. Communication with the customer is an
absolutely necessary part of any penetration testing engagement and due
to the sensitive nature of the engagement, communications of sensitive
information must be encrypted, especially the final report. Before the
testing begins, a means of secure communication must be established with
the client. Several common means of encryption are as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>PGP/GPG can be used to both communicate over e-mail and to encrypt
the final report (remember that subject lines are passed through in
plaintext)</p></li>
<li><p>A secure mailbox hosted on the customer’s network</p></li>
<li><p>Telephone</p></li>
<li><p>Face to face meetings</p></li>
<li><p>To deliver the final report, you can also store the report in an AES
encrypted archive file, but make sure that your archive utility
supports AES encryption using CBC.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Also ask what kinds of information can be put in writing and which
should be communicated only verbally. Some organizations have very good
reasons for limiting what security information is transmitted to them in
writing.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="rules-of-engagement">
<h2>Rules of Engagement<a class="headerlink" href="#rules-of-engagement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While the scope defines what will be tested, the rules of engagement
defines how that testing is to occur. These are two different aspects
which need to be handled independently from each other.</p>
<section id="timeline">
<h3>Timeline<a class="headerlink" href="#timeline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A clear timeline should be established for the engagement. While scope
defines the start and the end of an engagement, the rules of engagement
define everything in between. It should be understood that the timeline
will change as the test progresses. However, having a rigid timeline is
not the goal of creating one. Rather, having a timeline in place at the
beginning of a test will allow everyone involved to more clearly
identify the work that is to be done and the people who will be
responsible for said work. GANTT Charts and Work Breakdown Structures
are often used to define the work and the amount of time that each
specific piece of the work will take. Seeing the schedule broken down in
this manner aids those involved in identifying where resources need to
be applied and it helps the customer identify possible roadblocks which
many be encountered during testing.</p>
<p>There are a number of free GANTT Chart tools available on the Internet.
Many mangers identify closely with these tools. Because of this, they
are an excellent medium for communicating with the upper management of a
target organization.</p>
</section>
<section id="locations">
<h3>Locations<a class="headerlink" href="#locations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Another parameter of any given engagement which is important to
establish with the customer ahead of time is any destinations to which
the testers will need to travel during the test. This could be as simple
as identifying local hotels, or complex as identifying the applicable
laws of a specific target country.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for an organization to operate in multiple locations
and regions and a few select sites will need to be chosen for testing.
In these situations, travel to every customer location should be
avoided, instead, it should be determined if VPN connections to the
sites are available for remote testing.</p>
</section>
<section id="disclosure-of-sensitive-information">
<h3>Disclosure of Sensitive Information<a class="headerlink" href="#disclosure-of-sensitive-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While one of the goals of a given engagement may be to gain access to
sensitive information, certain information should not actually be viewed
or downloaded. This seems odd to newer testers, however, there are a
number of situations where the testers should not have the target data
in their possession. For example Personal Health Information (PHI),
under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),
this data must be protected. In some situations, the target system may
not have a firewall or anti-virus (AV) protecting it. In this sort of
situation, the testers being in possession of any and all Personally
Identifiable Information (PII) should be absolutely avoided.</p>
<p>However, if the data cannot be physically or virtually obtained, how can
it be proved that the testers indeed obtained access to the information?
This problem has been solved in a number of ways. There are ways to
prove that the vault door was opened without taking any of the money.
For instance, a screenshot of database schema and file permissions can
be taken, or the files themselves can be displayed without opening them
to displaying the content, as long as no PII is visible in the filenames
themselves.</p>
<p>How cautious the testers should be on a given engagement is a parameter
which needs to be discussed with the client, but the firm doing the
testing should always be sure to protect themselves in a legal sense
regardless of client opinion. Regardless of supposed exposure to
sensitive data, all report templates and tester machines should be
sufficiently scrubbed following each engagement. As a special side note,
if illegal data (i.e. child pornography) is discovered by the testers,
proper law enforcement officials should be notified immediately,
followed by the customer. Do not take direction from the customer.</p>
</section>
<section id="evidence-handling">
<h3>Evidence Handling<a class="headerlink" href="#evidence-handling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When handling evidence of a test and the differing stages of the report
it is incredibly important to take extreme care with the data. Always
use encryption and sanitize your test machine between tests. Never hand
out USB sticks with test reports out at security conferences. And
whatever you do, don’t re-use a report from another customer engagement
as a template! It’s very unprofessional to leave references to another
organization in your document.</p>
</section>
<section id="regular-status-meetings">
<h3>Regular Status Meetings<a class="headerlink" href="#regular-status-meetings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Throughout the testing process it is critical to have regular meetings
with the customer informing them of the overall progress of the test.
These meetings should be held daily and should be as short as possible.
Meetings should be kept to three concepts: plans, progress and problems.</p>
<p>Plans are generally discussed so that testing is not conducted during a
major unscheduled change or an outage. Progress is simply an update to
the customer on what has been completed so far. Problems should also be
discussed in this meeting, but in the interest of brevity, conversations
concerning solutions should almost always be taken offline.</p>
</section>
<section id="time-of-the-day-to-test">
<h3>Time of the Day to Test<a class="headerlink" href="#time-of-the-day-to-test" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Certain customers require all testing to be done outside of business
hours. This can mean late nights for most testers. The time of day
requirements should be well established with the customer before testing
begins.</p>
</section>
<section id="dealing-with-shunning">
<h3>Dealing with Shunning<a class="headerlink" href="#dealing-with-shunning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are times where shunning is perfectly acceptable and there are
times where it may not fit the spirit of the test. For example, if your
test is to be a full black-box test where you are testing not only the
technology, but the capabilities of the target organization’s security
team, shunning would be perfectly fine. However, when you are testing a
large number of systems in coordination with the target organization’s
security team it may not be in the best interests of the test to shun
your attacks.</p>
</section>
<section id="permission-to-test">
<h3>Permission to Test<a class="headerlink" href="#permission-to-test" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One of the most important documents which need to be obtained for a
penetration test is the Permission to Test document. This document
states the scope and contains a signature which acknowledges awareness
of the activities of the testers. Further, it should clearly state that
testing can lead to system instability and all due care will be given by
the tester to not crash systems in the process. However, because testing
can lead to instability the customer shall not hold the tester liable
for any system instability or crashes. It is critical that testing does
not begin until this document is signed by the customer.</p>
<p>In addition, some service providers require advance notice and/or
separate permission prior to testing their systems. For example, Amazon
has an online request form that must be completed, and the request must
be approved before scanning any hosts on their cloud. If this is
required, it should be part of the document.</p>
</section>
<section id="legal-considerations">
<h3>Legal Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#legal-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Some activities common in penetration tests may violate local laws. For
this reason, it is advised to check the legality of common pentest tasks
in the location where the work is to be performed. For example,any VOIP
calls captured in the course of the penetration test may be considered
wiretapping in some areas.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="capabilities-and-technology-in-place">
<h2>Capabilities and Technology in Place<a class="headerlink" href="#capabilities-and-technology-in-place" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Good penetration tests do not simply check for un-patched systems. They
also test the capabilities of the target organization. To that end,
below is a list of things that you can benchmark while testing.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Ability to detect and respond to information gathering</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to detect and respond to foot printing</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to detect and respond to scanning and vuln analysis</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to detect and respond to infiltration (attacks)</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to detect and respond to data aggregation</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to detect and respond to data ex-filtration</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When tracking this information be sure to collect time information. For
example, if a scan is detected you should be notified and note what
level of scan you were preforming at the time.</p>
