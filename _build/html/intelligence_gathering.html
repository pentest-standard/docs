<section id="general">
<h2>General<a class="headerlink" href="#general" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section defines the Intelligence Gathering activities of a
penetration test. The purpose of this document is to provide a standard
designed specifically for the pentester performing reconnaissance
against a target (typically corporate, military, or related). The
document details the thought process and goals of pentesting
reconnaissance, and when used properly, helps the reader to produce a
highly strategic plan for attacking a target.</p>
<section id="background-concepts">
<h3>Background Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#background-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Levels are an important concept for this document and for PTES as a
whole. It’s a maturity model of sorts for pentesting. Defining levels
allows us to clarify the expected output and activities within certain
real-world constraints such as time, effort, access to information, etc.</p>
<p>The Intelligence Gathering levels are currently split into three
categories, and a typical example is given for each one. These should
guide the adding of techniques in the document below. For example, an
intensive activity such as creating a facebook profile and analyzing the
target’s social network is appropriate in more advanced cases, and
should be labeled with the appropriate level. See the mindmap below for
examples.</p>
<section id="level-1-information-gathering">
<h4>Level 1 Information Gathering<a class="headerlink" href="#level-1-information-gathering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>(think: Compliance Driven) Mainly a click-button information gathering
process. This level of information can be obtained almost entirely by
automated tools. Bare minimum to say you did IG for a PT.</p>
<p>Acme Corporation is required to be compliant with PCI / FISMA / HIPAA. A
Level 1 information gathering effort should be appropriate to meet the
compliance requirement.</p>
</section>
<section id="level-2-information-gathering">
<h4>Level 2 Information Gathering<a class="headerlink" href="#level-2-information-gathering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>(think: Best Practice) This level can be created using automated tools
from level 1 and some manual analysis. A good understanding of the
business, including information such as physical location, business
relationships, org chart, etc.</p>
<p>Widgets Inc is required to be in compliance with PCI, but is interested
in their long term security strategy, and is acquiring several smaller
widget manufacturers. A Level 2 information gathering effort should be
appropriate to meet their needs.</p>
</section>
<section id="level-3-information-gathering">
<h4>Level 3 Information Gathering<a class="headerlink" href="#level-3-information-gathering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>(think: State Sponsored) More advanced pentest, Redteam, full-scope. All
the info from level 1 and level 2 along with a lot of manual analysis.
Think cultivating relationships on SocNet, heavy analysis, deep
understanding of business relationships, most likely a large number of
hours to accomplish the gathering and correlation.</p>
<p>An Army Red Team is tasked to analyze and attack a segment of the Army’s
network in a foreign country to find weaknesses that could be exploited
by a foreign national. A level 3 information gathering effort would be
appropriate in this case.</p>

<section id="what-it-is">
<h3>What it is<a class="headerlink" href="#what-it-is" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Intelligence Gathering is performing reconnaissance against a target to
gather as much information as possible to be utilized when penetrating
the target during the vulnerability assessment and exploitation phases.
The more information you are able to gather during this phase, the more
vectors of attack you may be able to use in the future.</p>
<p>Open source intelligence (OSINT) is a form of intelligence collection
management that involves finding, selecting, and acquiring information
from publicly available sources and analyzing it to produce actionable
intelligence.
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_intelligence">1</a></p>
</section>
<section id="why-do-it">
<h3>Why do it<a class="headerlink" href="#why-do-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We perform Open Source Intelligence gathering to determine various entry
points into an organization. These entry points can be physical,
electronic, and/or human. Many companies fail to take into account what
information about themselves they place in public and how this
information can be used by a determined attacker. On top of that many
employees fail to take into account what information they place about
themselves in public and how that information can be used to to attack
them or their employer.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-it-not">
<h3>What is it not<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-it-not" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>OSINT may not be accurate or timely. The information sources may be
deliberately/accidentally manipulated to reflect erroneous data,
information may become obsolete as time passes, or simply be incomplete.</p>
<p>It does not encompass dumpster-diving or any methods of retrieving
company information off of physical items found on-premises.</p>

<section id="target-selection">
<h2>Target Selection<a class="headerlink" href="#target-selection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<section id="identification-and-naming-of-target">
<h3>Identification and Naming of Target<a class="headerlink" href="#identification-and-naming-of-target" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When approaching a target organization it is important to understand
that a company may have a number of different Top Level Domains (TDLs)
and auxiliary businesses. While this information should have been
discovered during the scoping phase it is not all that unusual to
identify additional servers domains and companies that may not have been
part of the initial scope that was discussed in the pre-engagement
phase. For example a company may have a TDL of .com. However, they may
also have .net .co and .xxx. These may need to be part of the revised
scope, or they may be off limits. Either way it needs to be cleared with
the customer before testing begins. It is also not all that uncommon for
a company to have a number of sub-companies underneath them. For example
General Electric and Proctor and Gamble own a great deal of smaller
companies.</p>
</section>
<section id="consider-any-rules-of-engagement-limitations">
<h3>Consider any Rules of Engagement limitations<a class="headerlink" href="#consider-any-rules-of-engagement-limitations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At this point it is a good idea to review the Rules of Engagement. It is
common for these to get forgotten during a test. Sometimes, as testers
we get so wrapped up in what we find and the possibilities for attack
that we forget which IP addresses, domains and networks we can attack.
Always, be referencing the Rulles of Engagement to keep your tests
focused. This is not just important from a legel perspective, it is also
important from a scope creep perspective. Every time you get sidetracked
from the core objectives of the test it costs you time. And in the long
run that can cost your company money.</p>
</section>
<section id="consider-time-length-for-test">
<h3>Consider time length for test<a class="headerlink" href="#consider-time-length-for-test" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The amount of time for the total test will directly impact the amount of
Intelligence Gathering that can be done. There are some tests where the
total time is two to three months. In these engagements a testing
company would spend a tremendous amount of time looking into each of the
core business units and personal of the company. However, for shorter
crystal-box style tests the objectives may be far more tactical. For
example, testing a specific web application may not require you to
research the financial records of the company CEO.</p>
</section>
<section id="consider-end-goal-of-the-test">
<h3>Consider end goal of the test<a class="headerlink" href="#consider-end-goal-of-the-test" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Every test has an end goal in mind - a particular asset or process that
the organization considers critical. Having the end result in mind, the
intelligence gathering phase should make sure to include all secondary
and tertiary elements surrounding the end goal. Be it supporting
technologies, 3rd parties, relevant personnel, etc… Making sure the
focus is kept on the critical assets assures that lesser relevant
intelligence elements are de-prioritized and categorized as such in
order to not intervene with the analysis process.</p>

<section id="osint">
<h2>OSINT<a class="headerlink" href="#osint" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) takes three forms; Passive,
Semi-passive, and Active.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Passive Information Gathering</strong>: Passive Information Gathering is
generally only useful if there is a very clear requirement that the
information gathering activities never be detected by the target.
This type of profiling is technically difficult to perform as we are
never sending any traffic to the target organization neither from one
of our hosts or “anonymous” hosts or services across the Internet.
This means we can only use and gather archived or stored information.
As such this information can be out of date or incorrect as we are
limited to results gathered from a third party.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Semi-passive Information Gathering</strong>: The goal for semi-passive
information gathering is to profile the target with methods that
would appear like normal Internet traffic and behavior. We query only
the published name servers for information, we aren’t performing
in-depth reverse lookups or brute force DNS requests, we aren’t
searching for “unpublished” servers or directories. We aren’t running
network level portscans or crawlers and we are only looking at
metadata in published documents and files; not actively seeking
hidden content. The key here is not to draw attention to our
activities. Post mortem the target may be able to go back and
discover the reconnaissance activities but they shouldn’t be able to
attribute the activity back to anyone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Active Information Gathering</strong>: Active information gathering should
be detected by the target and suspicious or malicious behavior.
During this stage we are actively mapping network infrastructure
(think full port scans nmap –p1-65535), actively enumerating and/or
vulnerability scanning the open services, we are actively searching
for unpublished directories, files, and servers. Most of this
activity falls into your typically “reconnaissance” or “scanning”
activities for your standard pentest.</p></li>

<h5>Pervasiveness (L1)<a class="headerlink" href="#pervasiveness-l1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>It is not uncommon for a target organization to have multiple separate
physical locations. For example, a bank will have central offices, but
they will also have numerous remote branches as well. While physical and
technical security may be very good at central locations, remote
locations often have poor security controls.</p>

access them from the outside (when a touchgraph includes external
communities and is created with a depth level of above 2).
The basic touchgraph should reflect the organizational structure
derived from the information gathered so far, and further
expansion of the graph should be based on it (as it usually
represents the focus on the organizational assets better, and
make possible approach vectors clear.</p>

<li><p>Hoovers profile (L1/L2)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>What: a semi-open source intelligence resource (paid
subscriptions usually). Such sources specialize in gathering
business related information on companies, and providing a
“normalized” view on the business.
Why: The information includes physical locations, competitive
landscape, key personnel, financial information, and other
business related data (depending on the source). This can be used
to create a more accurate profile of the target, and identify
additional personnel and 3rd parties which can be used in the
test.
How: Simple search on the site with the business name provide the
entire profile of the company and all the information that is
available on it. Its recommended to use a couple of sources in
order to cross reference them and make sure you get the most
up-to-date information. (paid for service).</p>

types of technologies used within the organization. One example
would be if an organization has a job opening for a Senior
Solaris Sysadmin then it is pretty obvious that the organization
is using Solaris systems. Other positions may not be as obvious
by the job title, but an open Junior Network Administrator
position may say something to the effect of ‘CCNA preferred’ or

<div><p>RFPs and RFQs often reveal a lot of information about the types
of systems used by a company, and potentially even gaps or issues
with their infrastructure.
Finding out who current bid winners are may reveal the types of

<li><p>Political donations (L2/L3)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Mapping out political donations or other financial interests is
important in order to identify pivotal individuals who may not be
in obvious power positions but have a vested interest (or there
is a vested interes in them).
Political donation mapping will change between countries based on
the freedom of information, but often cases donations from other
countries can be traced back using the data available there.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Professional licenses or registries (L2/L3)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Gathering a list of your targets professional licenses and
registries may offer an insight into not only how the company
operated, but also the guidelines and regulations that they
follow in order to maintain those licenses. A prime example of
this is a companies ISO standard certification can show that a
company follows set guidelines and processes. It is important for
a tester to be aware of these processes and how they could affect
tests being performed on the organization.
A company will often list these details on their website as a
badge of honor. In other cases it may be necessary to search
registries for the given vertical in order to see if an
organization is a member. The information that is available is
very dependent on the vertical market, as well as the
geographical location of the company. It should also be noted
that international companies may be licensed differently and be
required to register with different standards or legal bodies
dependent on the country.</p>

<h5>Document Metadata (L1/L2)<a class="headerlink" href="#document-metadata-l1-l2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What it is? Metadata or meta-content provides information about the
data/document in scope. It can have information such as
author/creator name, time and date, standards used/referred, location
in a computer network (printer/folder/directory path/etc. info),
geo-tag etc. For an image its’ metadata can contain color, depth,
resolution, camera make/type and even the co-ordinates and location
information.</p></li>
<li><p>Why you would do it? Metadata is important because it contains
information about the internal network, user-names, email addresses,
printer locations etc. and will help to create a blueprint of the
location. It also contains information about software used in
creating the respective documents. This can enable an attacker to
create a profile and/or perform targeted attacks with internal
knowledge on the networks and users.</p></li>
<li><p>How you would do it? There are tools available to extract the
metadata from the file (pdf/word/image) like FOCA (GUI-based),
metagoofil (python-based), meta-extractor, exiftool (perl-based).
These tools are capable of extracting and displaying the results in
different formats as HTML, XML, GUI, JSON etc. The input to these
tools is mostly a document downloaded from the public presence of the
‘client’ and then analyzed to know more about it. Whereas FOCA helps
you search documents, download and analyzes all through its GUI
interface.</p></li>

<h2>Footprinting<a class="headerlink" href="#footprinting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>WHAT IT IS: External information gathering, also known as footprinting,
is a phase of information gathering that consists of interaction with
the target in order to gain information from a perspective external to
the organization.</p>
<p>WHY: Much information can be gathered by interacting with targets. By
probing a service or device, you can often create scenarios in which it
can be fingerprinted, or even more simply, a banner can be procured
which will identify the device. This step is necessary to gather more
information about your targets. Your goal, after this section, is a
prioritized list of targets.</p>

<h4>Identify Customer External Ranges<a class="headerlink" href="#identify-customer-external-ranges" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>One of the major goals of intelligence gathering during a penetration
test is to determine hosts which will be in scope. There are a number of
techniques which can be used to identify systems, including using
reverse DNS lookups, DNS bruting, WHOIS searches on the domains and the
ranges. These techniques and others are documented below.</p>

<section id="whois-lookups">
<h5>WHOIS Lookups<a class="headerlink" href="#whois-lookups" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>For external footprinting, we first need to determine which one of the
WHOIS servers contains the information we’re after. Given that we should
know the TLD for the target domain, we simply have to locate the
Registrar that the target domain is registered with.</p>
<p>WHOIS information is based upon a tree hierarchy. ICANN (IANA) is the
authoritative registry for all of the TLDs and is a great starting point
for all manual WHOIS queries.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>ICANN - <a class="reference external" href="http://www.icann.org">http://www.icann.org</a></p></li>
<li><p>IANA - <a class="reference external" href="http://www.iana.com">http://www.iana.com</a></p></li>
<li><p>NRO - <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nro.net">http://www.nro.net</a></p></li>
<li><p>AFRINIC - <a class="reference external" href="http://www.afrinic.net">http://www.afrinic.net</a></p></li>

<li><p>RIPE - <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ripe.net">http://www.ripe.net</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once the appropriate Registrar was queried we can obtain the Registrant
information. There are numerous sites that offer WHOIS information;
however for accuracy in documentation, you need to use only the

<h5>Port Scanning<a class="headerlink" href="#port-scanning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Port scanning techniques will vary based on the amount of time available
for the test, and the need to be stealthy. If there is zero knowledge of
the systems, a fast ping scan can be used to identify systems. In
addition, a quick scan without ping verification (-PN in nmap) should be
run to detect the most common ports avialable. Once this is complete, a
more comprehensive scan can be run. Some testers check for only open TCP
ports, make sure to check UDP as well. The <a class="reference external" href="http://nmap.org/nmap_doc.html">http://nmap.org/nmap_doc.html</a>
document details port scan types. Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is the de
facto standard for network auditing/scanning. Nmap runs on both Linux
and Windows.</p>
<p>You can find more information on the use of Nmap for this purpose in the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/PTES_Technical_Guidelines#Nmap_.28Windows.2FLinux.29">PTES Technical
Guideline</a></p>
<p>Nmap has dozens of options available. Since this section is dealing with
port scanning, we will focus on the commands required to perform this
task. It is important to note that the commands utilized depend mainly
on the time and number of hosts being scanned. The more hosts or less
time that you have to perform this tasks, the less that we will
interrogate the host. This will become evident as we continue to discuss
the options.</p>
<p>IPv6 should also be tested.</p>

<h5>Banner Grabbing<a class="headerlink" href="#banner-grabbing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Banner Grabbing is an enumeration technique used to glean information
about computer systems on a network and the services running its open
ports. Banner grabbing is used to identify network the version of
applications and operating system that the target host are running.</p>
<p>Banner grabbing is usually performed on Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
(HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
(SMTP); ports 80, 21, and 25 respectively. Tools commonly used to
perform banner grabbing are Telnet, nmap, and Netcat.</p>

<section id="snmp-sweeps">
<h5>SNMP Sweeps<a class="headerlink" href="#snmp-sweeps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>SNMP sweeps are performed too as they offer tons of information about a
specific system. The SNMP protocol is a stateless, datagram oriented
protocol. Unfortunately SNMP servers don’t respond to requests with
invalid community strings and the underlying UDP protocol does not
reliably report closed UDP ports. This means that “no response” from a
probed IP address can mean either of the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>machine unreachable</p></li>
<li><p>SNMP server not running</p></li>
<li><p>invalid community string</p></li>
<li><p>the response datagram has not yet arrived</p></li>

<h5>Zone Transfers<a class="headerlink" href="#zone-transfers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>DNS zone transfer, also known as AXFR, is a type of DNS transaction. It
is a mechanism designed to replicate the databases containing the DNS
data across a set of DNS servers. Zone transfer comes in two flavors,
full (AXFR) and incremental (IXFR). There are numerous tools available
to test the ability to perform a DNS zone transfer. Tools commonly used
to perform zone transfers are host, dig and nmap.</p>

<section id="smtp-bounce-back">
<h5>SMTP Bounce Back<a class="headerlink" href="#smtp-bounce-back" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>SMTP bounce back, also called a Non-Delivery Report/Receipt (NDR), a
(failed) Delivery Status Notification (DSN) message, a Non-Delivery
Notification (NDN) or simply a bounce, is an automated electronic mail
message from a mail system informing the sender of another message about
a delivery problem. This can be used to assist an attacker in
fingerprint the SMTP server as SMTP server information, including
software and versions, may be included in a bounce message.</p>
<p>This can be done by simply creating a bogus address within the target’s
domain. For instance, <a class="reference external" href="mailto:asDFADSF_garbage_address&#37;&#52;&#48;target&#46;com">asDFADSF_garbage_address<span>&#64;</span>target<span>&#46;</span>com</a> could be
used to test target.com. Gmail provides full access to the headers,
making it an easy choice for testers.</p>

<p>DNS discovery can be performed by looking at the WHOIS records for the

domain name should be checked, and the website should be checked for
references to other domains which could be under the target’s control.</p>

<section id="forward-reverse-dns">
<h5>Forward/Reverse DNS<a class="headerlink" href="#forward-reverse-dns" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Reverse DNS can be used to obtain valid server names in use within an
organizational. There is a caveat that it must have a PTR (reverse) DNS
record for it to resolve a name from a provided IP address. If it does
resolve then the results are returned. This is usually performed by
testing the server with various IP addresses to see if it returns any
results.</p>

<h5>DNS Bruteforce<a class="headerlink" href="#dns-bruteforce" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>After identifying all the information that is associated with the client
domain(s), it is now time to begin to query DNS. Since DNS is used to
map IP addresses to hostnames, and vice versa we will want to see if it
is insecurely configure. We will seek to use DNS to reveal additional
information about the client. One of the most serious misconfigurations
involving DNS is allowing Internet users to perform a DNS zone transfer.
There are several tools that we can use to enumerate DNS to not only
check for the ability to perform zone transfers, but to potentially
discover additional host names that are not commonly known.</p>

<p>Identifying the lockout threshold of an authentication service will
allow you to ensure that your bruteforce attacks do not intentionally
lock out valid users during your testing. Identify all disparate
authentication services in the environment, and test a single, innocuous
account for lockout. Often 5 - 10 tries of a valid account is enough to
determine if the service will lock users out.</p>

<h4>Identify Customer Internal Ranges<a class="headerlink" href="#identify-customer-internal-ranges" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When performing internal testing, first enumerate your local subnet, and
you can often extrapolate from there to other subnets by modifying the
address slightly. Also, a look a the routing table of an internal host
can be particularly telling. Below are a number of techniques which can
be used.</p>
<p>DHCP servers can be a potential source of not just local information,
but also remote IP range and details of important hosts. Most DHCP
servers will provide a local IP gateway address as well as the address
of DNS and WINS servers. In Windows based networks, DNS servers tend to
be Active Directory domain controllers, and thus targets of interest.</p>
