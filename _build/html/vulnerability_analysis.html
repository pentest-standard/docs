<h2>Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Vulnerability testing is the process of discovering flaws in systems and
applications which can be leveraged by an attacker. These flaws can
range anywhere from host and service misconfiguration, or insecure
application design. Although the process used to look for flaws varies
and is highly dependent on the particular component being tested, some
key principals apply to the process.</p>
<p>When conducting vulnerability analysis of any type the tester should
properly scope the testing for applicable depth and breadth to meet the
goals and/or requirements of the desired outcome. Depth values can
include such things as the location of an assessment tool,
authentication requirements, etc. For example; in some cases it maybe
the goal of the test to validate mitigation is in place and working and
the vulnerability is not accessible; while in other instances the goal
maybe to test every applicable variable with authenticated access in an
effort to discover all applicable vulnerabilities. Whatever your scope,
the testing should be tailored to meet the depth requirements to reach
your goals. Depth of testing should always be validated to ensure the
results of the assessment meet the expectation (i.e. did all the
machines authenticate, etc.). In addition to depth, breadth must also be
taken into consideration when conducting vulnerability testing. Breadth
values can include things such as target networks, segments, hosts,
application, inventories, etc. At its simplest element, your testing may
be to find all the vulnerabilities on a host system; while in other
instances you may need to find all the vulnerabilities on hosts with in
a given inventory or boundary. Additionally breadth of testing should
always be validated to ensure you have met your testing scope (i.e. was
every machine in the inventory alive at the time of scanning? If not,
why).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="active">
<h2>Active<a class="headerlink" href="#active" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Active testing involves direct interaction with the component being
tested for security vulnerabilities. This could be low level components
such as the TCP stack on a network device, or it could be components
higher up on the stack such as the web based interface used to
administer such a device. There are two distinct ways to interact with
the target component: automated, and manual.</p>
<p><strong>Automated</strong></p>
<p>Automated testing utilizes software to interact with a target, examine
responses, and determine whether a vulnerability exists based on those
responses. An automated process can help reduce time and labor
requirements. For example, while it is simple to connect to a single TCP
port on a system to determine whether it is open to receive incoming
data, performing this step once for each of the available 65,535
possible ports requires a significant amount of time if done manually.
When such a test must be repeated on multiple network addresses, the
time required may simply be too great to allow testing to be completed
without some form of automation. Using software to perform these
functions allows the tester to accomplish the task at hand, and focus
their attention on processing data and performing tasks which are better
suited to manual testing.</p>
<p><strong>Network/General Vulnerability Scanners</strong></p>
<p><em>Port Based</em></p>
<p>An automated port based scan is generally one of the first steps in a
traditional penetration test because it helps obtain a basic overview of
what may be available on the target network or host. Port based scanners
check to determine whether a port on a remote host is able to receive a
connection. Generally, this will involve the protocols which utilize IP
(such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.), However, ports on other network
protocols could be present as well dependent on the environment (for
example, it’s quite common in large mainframe environments for SNA to be
in use). Typically, a port can have one of two possible states:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open&nbsp;-&nbsp;the&nbsp;port&nbsp;is&nbsp;able&nbsp;to&nbsp;receive&nbsp;data</span></code></div>
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed&nbsp;-&nbsp;the&nbsp;port&nbsp;is&nbsp;not&nbsp;able&nbsp;to&nbsp;receive&nbsp;data</span></code></div>
</div>
<p>A scanner may list other states, such as “filtered”, if it is unable to
accurately determine whether a given port is open or closed.</p>
<p>When the scanner determines that a port is open, a presumption is made
by the scanner as to whether a vulnerability is present or not. For
example, if a port based scanner connects to TCP port 23, and that port
is listening, the scanner is likely to report that the telnet service is
available on the remote host, and flag it as having a clear text
authentication protocol enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Service Based</strong></p>
<p>A service based vulnerability scanner is one which utilizes specific
protocols to communicate with open ports on a remote host, to determine
more about the service that is running on that port. This is more
precise than a port scan, because it does not rely on the port alone to
determine what service is running. For example, a port scan may be able
to identify that TCP port 8000 is open on a host, but it will not know
based on that information alone what service is running there. A service
scanner would attempt to communicate with the port using different
protocols. If the service running on port 8000 is able to correctly
communicate using HTTP, then it will be identified as a web server.</p>
<p><strong>Banner Grabbing</strong></p>
<p>Banner grabbing is the process of connecting to a specific port and
examining data returned from the remote host to identify the
service/application bound to that port. Often in the connection process,
software will provide an identification string which may include
information such as the name of the application, or information about
which specific version of the software is running.</p>
<p><strong>Web Application Scanners</strong></p>
<p><strong>General application flaw scanners</strong></p>
<p>Most web application scans start with the address of a website, web
application, or web service. The scanner then crawls the site by
following links and directory structures. After compiling a list of
webpages, resources, services and/or other media offered, the scanner
will perform tests, or audits against the results of the crawl. For
example, if a webpage discovered in the crawl has form fields, the
scanner might attempt SQL injection or cross-site scripting. If the
crawled page contained errors, the scanner might look for sensitive
information displayed in the error detail, and so on.</p>
<p>It should be noted that crawling and testing phases can be staggered and
performed at the same time to reduce overall scanning time. This is the
default behavior for many web application scanners.</p>
<p><strong>Directory Listing/Brute Forcing</strong></p>
<p>Suppose there are directories available on the website that the crawler
won’t find by following links. Without prior knowledge of these
directories, provided by the user, the scanner has at least two
additional options.</p>
<p>The scanner/crawler can search for “common” directories. These are
directories with names and variants of names that are commonly found,
and are included in a list that has been compiled as the result of years
of experience and scanning. Most web applications have a “built-in” list
of this sort, while some penetration testers maintain their own custom
lists. Sometimes directory names are unique enough that they can be used
to identify a 3rd party web application with reasonably high accuracy.
An accurate directory list can often be the key to finding the
“administrative” portion of a website - a portion most penetration
testers should be highly interested in discovering.</p>
<p>Brute forcing directories is a similar approach, though instead of using
a static list, a tool is used to enumerate every possibility a directory
name could have. The downside of using this approach is that it has the
potential to crash or inundate the web server with requests and thus
cause a denial-of-service condition. Care should be taken to perform
directory brute forcing while someone is keeping a close watch on the
condition of the web server, especially in a production setting.</p>
<p>The reason you as the penetration tester would want to perform directory
listing is to extend your attack field or to find directories that could
contain sensitive information (which depending on the goal of the
penetration test, may lead to a major finding within it).</p>
<p><strong>Web Server Version/Vulnerability Identification</strong></p>
<p>Many web application scanners will attempt to compare the version of the
web server with known vulnerable versions in security advisories. This
approach can sometimes lead to false positives; as there are some cases
where open-source web servers are forked or copied and given new names,
banners, and assigned different version numbers. Additional steps should
be taken to verify that the web server is, in fact, running what the
banner, or web scanner reports.</p>
<p><em>Methods</em></p>
<p>Several web server methods are considered insecure, and can allow
attackers to gain varying levels of access to web server content. The
fact that these methods are part of the web server software, and not web
site content differentiates it from other vulnerabilities discussed thus
far. Some insecure methods include:</p>
<p>OPTIONS</p>
<p>While the HTTP OPTIONS method is not insecure by itself, it can allow an
attacker to easily enumerate the kinds of HTTP methods accepted by the
target server. Note, the OPTIONS method is not always accurate and each
of the methods below should be validated individually.</p>
<p>PUT/DELETE</p>
<p>Using the PUT method, an attacker can upload malicious content such as
HTML pages that could be used to transfer information, alter web content
or install malicious software on the web server. Using the DELETE method
an attacker could remove content or deface a site causing a disruption
of service.</p>
<p>Additionally, modern REST applications use PUT in a different manner:</p>
<p>Create-&gt;POST Read-&gt;GET Update-&gt;PUT Delete-&gt;DELETE</p>
<p>WebDAV</p>
<p>WebDAV is a component of the Microsoft Internet Information Server
(IIS). WebDAV stands for “Web-based Distributed Authoring and
Versioning” and is used for editing and file management. WebDAV
extensions are used by administrators to manage and edit Web content
remotely on IIS Web servers and can include PROPFIND, COPY, MOVE,
PROPPATCH, MKCOL, LOCK, and UNLOCK .WebDAV interacts with core operating
system components, which can expose a system to several possible
vulnerabilities. Some of these potential risks include:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffer&nbsp;overflow&nbsp;conditions&nbsp;due&nbsp;to&nbsp;improper&nbsp;handling&nbsp;of&nbsp;user&nbsp;requests</span></code></div>
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denial-of-service&nbsp;conditions&nbsp;from&nbsp;malformed&nbsp;requests</span></code></div>
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domain&nbsp;based&nbsp;scripting&nbsp;attacks</span></code></div>
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Privilege&nbsp;escalation</span></code></div>
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Execution&nbsp;of&nbsp;arbitrary&nbsp;code</span></code></div>
</div>
<p>TRACE/TRACK</p>
<p>Modern web servers support the TRACE HTTP method, which contains a flaw
that can lead to unauthorized information disclosure. The TRACE method
is used to debug web server connections and can allow the client to see
what is being received at the other end of the request chain. Enabled by
default in all major web servers, a remote attacker may abuse the HTTP
TRACE functionality to disclose sensitive information resulting in a
loss of confidentiality.</p>
<p><strong>Network Vulnerability Scanners/Specific Protocols</strong></p>
<p><strong>VPN</strong></p>
<p>Conventional vulnerability assessment tools are not capable of
performing the correct protocol negotiations with VPN devices that
service Internet Key Exchange (IKE). In situations where IKE is in use,
it will be necessary to use additional toolkits that can perform
functions such as accurate fingerprinting, back off patterns and
identify authentication mechanisms that are in use. By identifying these
attributes of a VPN device, weaknesses can be identified in running code
versions as well as authentication types such as static preshared keys.</p>
<p><strong>Voice Network Scanners</strong></p>
<p><em>War Dialing</em></p>
<p>Many organizations still utilize out of band access over telephone
lines. Using vulnerability assessment tools that are designed to conduct
war-dialing can determine weaknesses in authentication and network
architecture.</p>
<p><em>VoIP</em></p>
<p>Voice over IP technologies are now abundant within most organizations.
Many tools have been developed to conduct vulnerability analysis of VoIP
infrastructures. Using these tools, one can identify if VoIP networks
are properly segmented and potentials for leveraging these networks to
access core infrastructure systems or record phone conversations on a
target network may exist.</p>
<p><strong>Manual Direct Connections</strong></p>
<p>As with any automated process or technology, the margin for error always
exists. Instabilities in systems, network devices and network
connectivity may introduce inaccurate results during testing. It is
always recommended to execute manual direct connections to each protocol
or service available on a target system to validate the results of
automated testing as well as identifying all potential attack vectors
and previously unidentified weaknesses.</p>
<p><strong>Obfuscated</strong></p>
<p><em>Multiple Exit Nodes</em></p>
<p>Security monitoring and defense systems operate under the pretense of
identifying malicious activity from a specific IP address. In situations
where Intrusion Detection systems are deployed and monitoring activity,
sourcing assessment and attack activities from multiple IP addresses
provide more accurate results and lessen the opportunity for a
monitoring device on a target network to identify and respond.
Technologies such as TOR proxies can provide a means to conduct
assessment activities without sourcing from a single IP address.</p>
<p><em>IDS Evasion</em></p>
<p>When conducting assessment activities against a target environment where
IDS technologies are deployed, it may be necessary to perform evasion.
Using methods such as string manipulation, polymorphism, session
splicing, and fragmentation can provide more accurate results while
bypassing signature matching patterns implemented in IDS devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="passive">
<h2>Passive<a class="headerlink" href="#passive" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Metadata Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Metadata analysis involves looking at data that describes a file, as
opposed to the file data itself. A Microsoft Office document for
example, might list the document author, company, when the document was
last saved, when the document was created, and so on. Many documents
even allow for the entry of custom metadata. This could potentially
contain internal addresses and paths to servers, internal IP addresses,
and other information a penetration tester could use to gain additional
access or information.</p>
<p>Though metadata is quite common on documents located on a company’s
internal network, companies should take care to purge metadata before
making documents available to the public, or on the public Internet. For
this reason, any metadata an attacker could gain access to passively
(without directly attacking the target) should be considered a security
issue.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Monitoring</strong></p>
<p>Traffic monitoring is the concept of connecting to an internal network
and capturing data for offline analysis. Route poisoning is excluded
from this phase as these create “noise” on the network and can easily be
detected. It is often surprising how much sensitive data can be gleaned
from a “switched” network. This “leaking of data” onto a switched
network can be categorized as follows:</p>
<p>ARP/MAC cache overflow, causing switched packets to be broadcast - this
is common on Cisco switches that have improper ARP/MAC cache timing
configurations.</p>
<p>Etherleak - some older network drivers and some embedded drivers will
use data from system memory to pad ARP packets. If enough ARP packets
can be collected, sensitive information from internal memory can be
captured</p>
<p>Misconfigured clusters or load balancers</p>
<p>Hubs plugged into the network Note that some of these categories only
result in data leakage to a single subnet, while others can result in
leakage to much larger network segments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="validation">
<h2>Validation<a class="headerlink" href="#validation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Correlation between Tools</strong></p>
<p>When working with multiple tools the need for correlation of findings
can become complicated. Correlation can be broken down into two distinct
styles, specific and categorical correlation of items, both are useful
based on the type of information, metrics and statistics you are trying
to gather on a given target.</p>
<p>Specific correlation relates to a specific definable issue such as
vulnerability ID, CVE, OSVDB, vendor indexing numbers, known issue with
a software product, etc. and can be grouped with micro factors such as
hostname, IP, FQDN, MAC Address etc. An example of this would be
grouping the findings for host x by CVE number as they would index the
same issue in multiple tools.</p>
<p>Categorical correlation relates to a categorical structure for issues
such as in compliance frameworks (i.e. NIST SP 800-53, DoD 5300 Series,
PCI, HIPPA, OWASP List, etc.) that allow you to group items by macro
factors such as vulnerability types, configuration issues, etc. An
example of this would be grouping all the findings for hosts with
default passwords into a group for password complexity within NIST
800-53 (IA-5).</p>
<p>In most cases penetration testers are going to focus on the micro issues
of specific vulnerabilities found in redundancy between multiple tools
on the same host. This redundancy can skew the statistical results in
the test output leading to a false increased risk profile.</p>
<p>The inverse of this is with an over reduction or simplification in macro
correlation (i.e. top 10/20 lists) as the results can skew the output
resulting in a false reduced risk profile.</p>
<p><strong>Manual Testing/Protocol Specific</strong></p>
<p><strong>VPN</strong></p>
<p><em>Fingerprinting</em></p>
<p>Fingerprinting is useful to determine the type of VPN device and correct
version of code released installed. By accurately fingerprinting the
device, proper research and analysis can then be conducted against the
target system.</p>
<p><em>Authentication</em></p>
<p>VPN devices can operate with various forms of authentication. Using VPN
toolkits that are not part of conventional vulnerability assessment
tools allow for proper identification of the authentication mechanisms
and determine weaknesses that may exist such as pre-shared keys or
default group IDs.</p>
<p><strong>Citrix</strong></p>
<p><em>Enumeration</em></p>
<p>Many default installations and poorly configured Citrix appliances
provide a means to enumerate published applications and determine valid
usernames that are configured to authenticate to the device. This
information becomes crucial during brute force attacks and attempts to
break out of predefined profiles for authorized users.</p>
<p><strong>DNS</strong></p>
<p>Domain Name Systems can offer an abundance of information to an attacker
when they are not properly hardened. Version information allow for
proper identification and accurate research analysis. Weaknesses such as
zone transfers provide an exhaustive list of additional targets for
attack as well as information leakage of potentially sensitive data
pertaining to the target organization.</p>
<p><strong>Web</strong></p>
<p>Web services provide a large landscape for an attacker. Unlike most
other protocols and services, web services are often found running on
multiple ports of a single system. Administrators may focus their
hardening on the common ports for web services or published directories
and neglect to properly harden additional attributes. Web services
should always be reviewed in a manual fashion as automated assessment
tools are not capable of identifying most weaknesses in their services.</p>
<p><strong>Mail</strong></p>
<p>Mail servers can provide an abundance of information about a target
organization. Using inherent functions in the target device,
confirmation of valid accounts can be conducted as well as developing a
list of potential usernames for additional attacks on other systems.
Vulnerabilities such as mail relaying can be leveraged for additional
attacks on the organization such as phishing. Often, mail servers will
provide a web interface for remote access that can be targeted in brute
force campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Attack Avenues</strong></p>
<p><strong>Creation of attack trees</strong></p>
<p>During a security assessment, it is crucial to the accuracy of the final
report to develop an attack tree as testing progresses throughout the
engagement. As new systems, services and potential vulnerabilities are
identified; an attack tree should be developed and regularly updated.
This is especially important during the exploitation phases of the
engagement as one point of entry that materializes could be repeated
across other vectors mapped out during the development of the attack
tree.</p>
<p><strong>Isolated Lab Testing</strong></p>
<p>The accuracy of vulnerability analysis and exploitation is substantially
greater when replicated environments are setup in an isolated lab. Often
times, systems may be hardened with specific control sets or additional
protection mechanisms. By designing a lab that mimics that of the target
organization, the consultant can ensure that the vulnerabilities
identified and exploits attempted against the desired targets are
reliable and lessen the opportunity for inaccurate results or system
inoperability.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Confirmation</strong></p>
<p><em>Manual Connection with Review</em></p>
<p>While proper correlation can help reduce false findings and increase
overall accuracy, there is no substitute for visually inspecting a
target system. Assessment tools are designed to review the results of a
protocol/service connection or the response and compare to known
signatures of vulnerabilities. However, tools are not always accurate in
identifying services on uncommon ports or custom logic that may be built
into an application. By manually assessing a target system, its services
available and the applications that provide functionality for those
services, a tester can ensure that proper validation and vulnerability
identification have been completed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="research">
<h2>Research<a class="headerlink" href="#research" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Public Research</strong></p>
<p>Once a vulnerability has been reported in a target system, it is
necessary to determine the accuracy of the identification of the issue,
and to research the potential exploitability of the vulnerability within
the scope of the penetration test. In many cases, the vulnerability will
be a reported software vulnerability in a commercial or open source
software package, and in other cases the vulnerability can be a flaw in
a business process, or a common administrative error like
misconfiguration or default password usage.</p>
<p><em>Vulnerability Databases</em></p>
<p>Vulnerability databases can be used to verify an issue reported by an
automated tool, or to manually review the vulnerability of a target
application. Most tools will use the CVE identifier for a given
vulnerability, which can be used to access the summary information and
links to other sources in the CVE database. The CVE can also be used to
search for the issue in vulnerability databases like OSVDB and Bugtraq,
or in exploit databases and frameworks.</p>
<p>Vulnerability databases should be used to verify the accuracy of a
reported issue. For example, an Apache web server flaw can exist on
Windows, but not on Linux, which may not be taken into account by an
automated scanner.</p>
<p><em>Vendor Advisories</em></p>
<p>Vendor-issued security advisories and change logs can provide pointers
to vulnerability information that may not be reported by any automated
tools. Many major software vendors report limited details on internally
discovered issues and issues where an independent researcher coordinates
the disclosure of a vulnerability. If the researcher chooses to remain
silent on the details of the vulnerability, the vendor advisory is
frequently the only data available. In these cases, other researchers
may discover more details independently, and add the details to
vulnerability databases. Searching for the CVE used in a vendor advisory
may turn up more detail on a potentially exploitable issue.</p>
<p>Change logs can provide guidance for additional research, especially in
open source products, where a diff between versions can reveal a
vulnerability which was fixed but not widely known, and perhaps not
prioritized for upgrade or installation as a result.</p>
<p><strong>Exploit Databases and Framework Modules</strong></p>
<p>Many exploit databases are actively maintained and publicly accessible
on the Internet. Security researchers and exploit writers do not always
submit their exploit code to multiple sites, so it is advisable to
become familiar with several sites, and check each one for exploit code
to use against potentially vulnerable applications. While some
vulnerability databases track exploit availability, their coverage is
usually incomplete and should not be considered exhaustive.</p>
<p>Commercial and open source exploit frameworks can also prove useful in
researching vulnerabilities. In most cases, available exploit modules
are listed on their public web sites, and can be a valuable indication
of the exploitability of an issue.</p>
<p><strong>Common/default Passwords</strong></p>
<p>Frequently, administrators and technicians choose weak passwords, never
change the default or do not set any password at all. Manuals for most
software and hardware can be easily found online, and will provide the
default credentials. Internet forums and official vendor mailing lists
can provide information on undocumented accounts, commonly-used
passwords and frequently misconfigured accounts. Finally, many web sites
document default/backdoor passwords and should be checked for every
identified system.</p>
<p><strong>Hardening Guides/Common Misconfigurations</strong></p>
<p>One of the primary goals of penetration testing is to simulate the
tactics and behavior of an actual attacker. While automated scanning can
reduce the time window of a test, no scanner can behave like a human
being. Hardening guides can be an invaluable reference for a penetration
tester. They not only highlight the weakest parts of a system, but you
can gain a sense of the diligence of an administrator by validating how
many recommendations have been implemented. During every penetration
test, time should be taken to review every major system and its
recommended hardening settings, in order to discover vulnerabilities
left in place by the administrator.</p>
<p>User forums and mailing lists can provide valuable information about
systems and the various issues administrators have in configuring and
securing them. A tester should research target systems as if he were
installing one himself, and discover where the pain points and probable
configuration errors will lie.</p>
<p><strong>Private Research</strong></p>
<p><em>Setting up a replica environment</em></p>
<p>Virtualization technologies allow a security researcher to run a wide
variety of operating systems and applications, without requiring
dedicated hardware. When a target operating system or application has
been identified, a virtual machine (VM) environment can be quickly
created to mimic the target. The tester can use this VM to explore to
configuration parameters and behaviors of the application, without
directly connecting to the target.</p>
<p><em>Testing Configurations</em></p>
<p>A testing VM lab should contain base images for all common operating
systems, including Windows XP, Vista, 7, Server 2003 and Server 2008,
Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat and Mac OS X, where possible. Maintaining
separate images for each service pack level will streamline the process
of recreating the target’s environment. A complete VM library in
combination with a VM environment that supports cloning will allow a
tester to bring up a new target VM in minutes. Additionally, using a
snapshot feature will allow to work more efficiently and to reproduce
bugs.</p>
<p><em>Fuzzing</em></p>
<p>Fuzzing, or fault injection, is a brute-force technique for finding
application flaws by programmatically submitting valid, random or
unexpected input to the application. The basic process involves
attaching a debugger to the target application, and then running the
fuzzing routine against specific areas of input and then analyzing the
program state following any crashes. Many fuzzing applications are
available, although some testers write their own fuzzers for specific
targets.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying potential avenues/vectors</strong></p>
<p>Log in or connect to a target network application to identify commands
and other areas of input. If the target is a desktop application that
reads files and/or web pages, analyze the accepted file formats for
avenues of data input. Some simple tests involve submitting invalid
characters, or very long strings of characters to cause a crash. Attach
a debugger to analyze the program state in the event of a successful
crash.</p>
<p><strong>Disassembly and code analysis</strong></p>
<p>Some programming languages allow for decompilation, and some specific
applications are compiled with symbols for debugging. A tester can take
advantage of these features to analyze program flow and identify
potential vulnerabilities. Source code for open source applications
should be analyzed for flaws. Web applications written in PHP share many
of the same vulnerabilities, and their source code should be examined as
part of any test.</p>
