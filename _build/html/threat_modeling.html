<section id="general">
<h2>General<a class="headerlink" href="#general" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section defines a threat modeling approach as required for a
correct execution of a penetration test. The standard does not use a
specific model, but instead requires that the model used be consistent
in terms of its representation of threats, their capabilities, their
qualifications as per the organization being tested, and the ability to
repeatedly be applied to future tests with the same results.</p>
<p>The standard focuses on two key elements of traditional threat modeling
- assets and attacker (threat community/agent). Each one is respectively
broken down into business assets and business processes and the threat
communities and their capabilities.</p>
<p>As a minimum, all four elements should be clearly identified and
documented in every penetration test.</p>
<p>When modeling the attacker side, on top of the threat community (which
is mostly semantic and can be tied back to the organization’s business
SWOT analysis), and the capabilities (which is mostly technical),
additional aspects of motivation modeling should also be provided. These
additional points essentially take into account the value of the
different assets available at the target and are combined with the cost
of acquiring it. As a complementary model, impact modeling should also
be performed for the organization in order to provide a more accurate
view of the “what-if?” scenario surrounding the loss event of each of
the identified assets. This should take into account the assets “net”
value, its intrinsic value, and other indirectly incurred costs
associated with a loss event.</p>
<p>The threat modeling phase of any penetration testing engagement is
critical for both the testers, as well as the organization. It provides
clarity as far as the organization’s risk appetite and prioritization
(which assets are more important than others? what threat communities
are more relevant than others?). Additionally, it enables the tester to
focus on delivering an engagement that closely emulates the tools,
techniques, capabilities, accessibility and general profile of the
attacker, while keeping in mind what are the actual targets inside the
organization such that the more relevant controls, processes, and
infrastructure are put to the test rather than an inventory list of IT
elements. The threat model should be constructed in coordination with
the organization being tested whenever possible, and even in a complete
black-box situation where the tester does not have any prior information
on the organization, the tester should create a threat model based on
the attacker’s view in combination with OSINT related to the target
organization.</p>
<p>The model should be clearly documented, and be delivered as part of the
final report as the findings in the report will reference the threat
model in order to create a more accurate relevance and risk score that
is specific to the organization (rather than a generic technical one).</p>

<h3>Example<a class="headerlink" href="#example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the light of a PTES assessment the internally hosted CRM application
may be in scope. The customer information stored in the back-end
database is an easily identifiable primary asset as it is directly
linked to the application in scope. However, by reviewing the technical
design of the database server, it can also be identified that the HR
database stored on the same back-end database server is a secondary
asset. An attacker can use the CRM application as a stepping stone to
obtain employee information. In a basic threat modeling exercise,
certain threat communities may be identified as not relevant when mapped
to the CRM application, but by identifying the secondary assets the
threat landscape suddenly changes.</p>
</section>
<section id="high-level-modeling-tools">
<h3>High level modeling tools<a class="headerlink" href="#high-level-modeling-tools" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are a variety of tools available to identify targets and map
attack vectors. These normally focus on the business assets (what
systems to target) and business processes (how to attack them.)
Depending on the engagement, the penetration testing team may perform
these exercises with no input from the customer; or they may spend a lot
of time with customer stakeholders identifying targets of interest.
Tools with a business asset focus usually require a quantitative input
to describe how important each potential target is to test. The inputs
may also be qualitative, such as a description by the customer’s CIO
that a system is mission-critical. Tools focused on business processes,
information flows and technical architecture are used to identify
potential attack vectors and choose which are mostly likely to succed or
most likely to be used by a certain class of adversary.</p>

<h2>Business Asset Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#business-asset-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>During the business asset analysis part of the threat modeling exercise
an asset-centric view is taken on all assets, and business processes
they support them, included in the scope. By analyzing the gathered
documentation and interviewing relevant personnel within the
organization, the pentester is able to identify the assets that are most
likely to be targeted by an attacker, what their value is and what the
impact of their (partial) loss would be.</p>

<section id="technical-information">
<h4>Technical Information<a class="headerlink" href="#technical-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Technical information about the organization, and the organization’s
operations, is of unique interest to the penetration tester. Such
information is often not the expected deliverable of a penetration test,
however, it facilitates the testing process by feeding valuable
information to other areas; infrastructure design information may
provide valuable data to the Intelligence Gathering process.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Infrastructure Design Information</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Infrastructure design related information pertains to all the core
technologies and facilities used to run the organization. Building
blueprints, technical wiring and connectivity diagrams, computing
equipment/networking designs, and application level data processing are
all considered infrastructure design information.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>System Configuration Information</p></li>
</ul>
<p>System configuration information includes configuration baseline
documentation, configuration checklists and hardening procedures, group
policy information, operating system images, software inventories, etc.
This information could aid the discovery of vulnerabilities (such as
through the knowledge of configuration errors or outdated software
installations).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>User Account Credentials</p></li>
</ul>
<p>User account credentials help facilitate access to the information
system, at a non-privileged level, as long as a means to authenticate
exists (e.g. VPN, web portal, etc.).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Privileged User Account Credentials</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Privileged user account credentials help facilitate access to the
information system, at an elevated level of access, as long as a means
to authenticate exists (e.g. VPN, web portal, etc.). Obtaining
privileged user account credentials often leads to compromise of the
information system being tested.</p>
</section>
<section id="employee-data">
<h4>Employee Data<a class="headerlink" href="#employee-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Here employee data is being analyzed as any data that can have a DIRECT
affect on the organization is obtained or compromised by an attacker.
Organizations that have to adhere to some compliance which places fines
on the loss or exposure of such data are obvious candidates for such a
direct loss effect. Also, organizations who’s employees may be
considered critical assets may also be subjected to such scrutiny
(specific government bodies, specialized trade secret related
employees/departments, etc…). The following list provides examples to
information realms of personal data that may be considered business
assets for the threat modeling.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>National Identification Numbers (SSNs, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</p></li>
<li><p>Protected Health Information (PHI)</p></li>
<li><p>Financial Information (e.g. bank, credit accounts)</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="customer-data">
<h4>Customer Data<a class="headerlink" href="#customer-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Much like employee data, customer data is considered a business asset in
the threat modeling process when such information will incur a
direct/indirect loss to the organization. On top of
regulatory/compliance need (based on fines), an additional factor comes
into play here when such data can be used to conduct fraud, where the
organization may be held liable or sued for the losses related to the
fraud (based on losing the customer information that enabled the fraud
to take place). The following list provides examples of such information
realms that may hold relevant customer data and should be considered
business assets for the sake of the threat modeling</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>National Identification Numbers (SSN’s, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</p></li>
<li><p>Protected Health Information (PHI)</p></li>
<li><p>Financial Accounts (e.g. bank, credit, equity accounts)</p></li>
<li><p>Supplier Data</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Information related to suppliers that is considered critical to the
organization (such as critical component manufacturers, agreements with
suppliers that may be part of a trade secret, cost analysis of supplied
components), as well as any data that may be used to affect the business
operations of the organization through its suppliers is considered a
business asset.</p>

<section id="human-assets">
<h3>Human Assets<a class="headerlink" href="#human-assets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When identifying human assets in an organization, we have to remember
that the context is having such assets part of a greater effort to
compromise the organization. As such, human assets that are identified
as business assets are those that could be leveraged to divulge
information, manipulated to make decisions or actions that would
adversely affect the organization or enable an attacker to further
compromise it. Human assets are not necessarily the highest up within
the corporate hierarchy, but are more often key personnel that are
related to previously identified business assets, or are in positions to
enable access to such assets. This list can also include employees that
normally would not be associated with access to restricted company
assets, but may be in a position to grant physical access to a company
that facilitates a breach of security or procedure. The following list
provides some examples of such assets, and should be adapted to the
organization being tested.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Executive Management</p></li>
<li><p>Executive Assistants</p></li>
<li><p>Middle Management</p></li>
<li><p>Administrative Assistants</p></li>

<section id="business-process-analysis">
<h2>Business Process Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#business-process-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A business isn’t a business if it doesn’t make money. The way this
happens is by having either raw goods or knowledge run through various
processes to enhance them and create added value. This generates
revenue. Business processes and the assets (people, technology, money)
supporting them form value chains. By mapping these processes,
identifying the critical vs. non-critical processes and eventually
finding flaws in them we are able to understand how the business works,
what makes them money and eventually how specific threat communities can
make them lose money.</p>
<p>In the business process analysis we differentiate between critical
business processes, and non-critical processes. For each category the
analysis is the same, and takes into account the same elements. The main
difference is in the weighting that the threat from a critical business
process is assigned with as opposed to a non-critical one. Nevertheless,
it’s imperative to remember that an aggregation of a few non-critical
business processes can be combined into a scenario that essentially
forms a critical flaw within an element/process. Such threat scenarios
should also be identified within this phase and mapped out for later use
in the penetration test.</p>
<section id="technical-infrastructure-supporting-process">
<h3>Technical infrastructure supporting process<a class="headerlink" href="#technical-infrastructure-supporting-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As business processes are usually supported by IT infrastructure (such
as computer networks, processing power, PCs for entering information and
managing the business process, etc…), all those elements must be
identified and mapped. Such mapping should be clear enough to be used
later on in the process when translating the threat model to the
vulnerability mapping and exploitation.</p>
</section>
<section id="information-assets-supporting-process">
<h3>Information assets supporting process<a class="headerlink" href="#information-assets-supporting-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Contrary to technical infrastructure, information assets are existing
knowledge bases in the organization that are used as either a reference,
or as support material (decision making, legal, marketing, etc…). Such
assets are usually identified in the business process already, and
should be mapped alongside the technical infrastructure, as well as any
additional technical infrastructure that supports the information assets
themselves.</p>
</section>
<section id="human-assets-supporting-process">
<h3>Human assets supporting process<a class="headerlink" href="#human-assets-supporting-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Identification of the HR that are involved in the business process
should be made in conjunction with the process analysis itself (whether
documented or not), and every person that has any kind of involvement
(even if it does not relate to a specific information asset or a
technical infrastructure element) should be documented and mapped in the
process. Such HR assets are usually part of an approval sub-process, a
verification sub-process, or even a reference (such as legal advice).
These kinds of assets (especially ones that have no relation to
information assets or technical infrastructure) would be later mapped to
attack vectors that are more social than technical in nature.</p>

<h3>3rd party integration and/or usage of/by process<a class="headerlink" href="#rd-party-integration-and-or-usage-of-by-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Similar to human assets supporting the process, any 3rd party that has
any involvement with the business process should be mapped as well. This
category can be tricky to map out, as it could contain both human
assets, as well as information/technical ones (such as a SaaS provider).</p>

<section id="threat-agents-community-analysis">
<h2>Threat Agents/Community Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#threat-agents-community-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When defining the relevant threat communities and agents, a clear
identification of the threat should be provided in terms of location
(internal / external to the organization), the specific community within
the location, and any additional relevant information that would assist
in establishing a capabilities/motivation profile for the specific
agent/community. Where possible, specific agents should be identified.
Otherwise, a more general community should be outlined, along-with any
supporting material and intelligence. Some examples of threat
agent/community classifications are:</p>

<h3>Employees<a class="headerlink" href="#employees" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Persons working directly for the company under a part-time or full-time

most of them are relying on the company to make a living and, assuming
they are treated well, are inclined to protect the company rather than
to hurt it. Oftentimes involved in data loss incidents or accidental
compromise. In rare cases they may be motivated by outsiders to assist

<h2>Threat Capability Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#threat-capability-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once a threat community has been identified, the capabilities of said
community must also be analyzed in order to build an accurate threat
model that reflects the actual probability of such a community/agent to
successfully act upon the organization and compromise it. This analysis
requires both a technical analysis as well as an opportunity analysis
(where applicable).</p>
<section id="analysis-of-tools-in-use">
<h3>Analysis of tools in use<a class="headerlink" href="#analysis-of-tools-in-use" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Any tools that are known to be available to the threat community/agent
are to be included here. Additionally, tools that may be freely
available should be analyzed for the required skill level needed to be
able to utilize them to their potential, and mapped in the threat
capability.</p>

<section id="availability-to-relevant-exploits-payloads">
<h3>Availability to relevant exploits/payloads<a class="headerlink" href="#availability-to-relevant-exploits-payloads" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The threat community/agent should be analyzed in terms of its capability
to either obtain or develop exploits for the environment relevant to the
organization. Additionally, accessibility to such exploits/payloads
through 3rd parties, business partners, or underground communities
should also be to taken into account in this analysis.</p>

<section id="communication-mechanisms">
<h3>Communication mechanisms<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-mechanisms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An analysis of communication mechanisms available to the threat
agent/community should be made to evaluate the complexity of attacks
against an organization. These communication mechanisms range from
simple and openly available technologies such as encryption, through to
specialist tools and services such as bulletproof hosting, use of
drop-sites, and the use of known or unknown botnets to perform attacks
or mask source information. For example, as part of testing we test to
see what the overall attack surface for an organization is from the
outside. However, there is another whole component that is often times
missed. What types of threats can exist post exploitation? This falls
under the context of detecting exfiltration channels. Coincidentally,
penetration testers are uniquely situated to test an organizations
capability to detect command and control channels of today’s modern
malware. When this is in scope, we recommend the tester create a series
of malware specimens that increase the level of obfuscation used to hide
C2. The goal is to create malware that is easily detected, then increase
the obfuscation to the point where detection no longer occurs.</p>

<section id="accessibility">
<h3>Accessibility<a class="headerlink" href="#accessibility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The final element in the threat actor capability analysis is their
accessibility to the organization and/or the specific assets in
question. Completing the profile depicted above while factoring in
accessibility analysis would enable the penetration test to create clear
scenarios that are relevant to the organization’s risk.</p>

<section id="motivation-modeling">
<h2>Motivation Modeling<a class="headerlink" href="#motivation-modeling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The possible motivation of threat agents/communities should be noted for
further analysis. Motivations of attackers are constantly changing, as
can be seen by the increase in hacktivism branded attacks by groups such
as Anonymous and Antisec. There will be subtle differences in unique
motivations based on each organization and/or vertical market, some
common motivations include :</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Profit (direct or indirect)</p></li>
<li><p>Hacktivism</p></li>
<li><p>Direct grudge</p></li>
<li><p>Fun / Reputation</p></li>
<li><p>Further access to partner/connected systems</p></li>

<h2>Finding relevant news of comparable Organizations being compromised<a class="headerlink" href="#finding-relevant-news-of-comparable-organizations-being-compromised" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to provide a complete threat model, a comparison to other
organizations within the same industry vertical should be provided. This
comparison should include any relevant incidents or news related to such
organizations and the challenges they face. Such a comparison is used to
validate the threat model and offer a baseline for the organization to
compare itself to (taking into account that this publicly available
information only represents a portion of the actual threats and
incidents the compared organization actually face).</p>
