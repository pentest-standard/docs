The Penetration Testing Execution Standard

Fork Disclaimer

Note that this is an unofficial fork, the goal for which is to experiment with an alternative platform for the standard. The official PTES can be located at `<http://pentest-standard.org/>`_.

High Level Organization of the Standard
=======================================

The penetration testing execution standard consists of seven (7) main
sections. These cover everything related to a penetration test - from
the initial communication and reasoning behind a pentest, through the
intelligence gathering and threat modeling phases where testers are
working behind the scenes in order to get a better understanding of the
tested organization, through vulnerability research, exploitation and
post exploitation, where the technical security expertise of the testers
come to play and combine with the business understanding of the
engagement, and finally to the reporting, which captures the entire
process, in a manner that makes sense to the customer and provides the
most value to it.

This version can be considered a v1.0 as the core elements of the
standard are solidified, and have been "road tested" for over a year
through the industry. A v2.0 is in the works soon, and will provide more
granular work in terms of "levels" - as in intensity levels at which
each of the elements of a penetration test can be performed at. As no
pentest is like another, and testing will range from the more mundane
web application or network test, to a full-on red team engagement, said
levels will enable an organization to define how much sophistication
they expect their adversary to exhibit, and enable the tester to step up
the intensity on those areas where the organization needs them the most.
Some of the initial work on "levels" can be seen in the intelligence
gathering section.

Following are the main sections defined by the standard as the basis for
penetration testing execution:

#. :ref:`preengagement_interactions`
#. :ref:`intelligence_gathering`
#. :ref:`threat_modeling`
#. :ref:`vulnerability_analysis`
#. :ref:`exploitation`
#. :ref:`post_exploitation`
#. :ref:`reporting`

As the standard does not provide any technical guidelines as far as how
to execute an actual pentest, we have also created a technical guide to
accompany the standard itself. The technical gude can be reached via the
